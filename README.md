Dotfiles
========

These are dotfiles I find significant enough to share between my platforms.

To get this to actually work:
- Run this: git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle
- Copy over the .vimrc into ~/.vimrc
- open vim and run BundleInstall

Leader macros:
- \f, nerdtree toggle
