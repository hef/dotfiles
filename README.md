Dotfiles
========

These are dotfiles I find significant enough to share between my platforms.

To get this to actually work:

    sudo aptitude install cmake python-dev
    git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle
    vim +BundleInstall +qall
    cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
    ./install.sh --clang-completer

Leader macros:
- \f, nerdtree toggle
- \u, Global Undo
